# Mutex Hierarchy and Concurrency Management

This document outlines the mutex usage throughout the Wordpress Inference Engine application, explaining how concurrency is managed across different components.

## Overview

The application uses mutexes to protect shared resources and ensure thread safety in a concurrent environment. Different components have their own mutexes to manage access to their internal state, and there are specific patterns used to avoid deadlocks and race conditions.

## Mutex Hierarchy

### 1. Service-Level Mutexes

These mutexes protect the core services that manage external resources and maintain state.

#### 1.1 WordPressService Mutex

**Location**: `wordpress/wordpress_service.go`

```go
type WordPressService struct {
    // ...
    mutex              sync.Mutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- Connection state (`isConnected`)
- Site credentials (`siteURL`, `username`, `appPassword`)
- Saved sites list (`savedSites`)
- Current site name (`currentSiteName`)

**Usage Pattern**:
- Uses `defer` for most operations to ensure unlock happens even on error paths
- Manual lock/unlock in `Connect()` method to allow callback execution outside the lock

**Critical Sections**:
- `GetCurrentSiteName()`: Protects read access to the current site name
- `SaveSite()`: Protects updates to the saved sites list
- `LoadSavedSites()`: Protects loading site data from disk
- `GetSavedSites()`: Protects read access to the saved sites list
- `GetSavedSite()`: Protects read access to a specific saved site
- `DeleteSavedSite()`: Protects deletion from the saved sites list
- `Connect()`: Protects the connection state during authentication
- `IsConnected()`: Protects read access to the connection state
- `GetPages()`: Protects access to connection details before making API calls

**Special Considerations**:
- The `Connect()` method uses a manual unlock before calling the site change callback to avoid holding the lock during callback execution, which could lead to deadlocks if the callback tries to access the service.

#### 1.2 InferenceService Mutex

**Location**: `inference/inference_service.go`

```go
type InferenceService struct {
    // ...
    mutex          sync.Mutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- Service running state (`isRunning`)
- LLM instances (`primaryAttempts`, `fallbackAttempts`)
- MOA (Mixture of Agents) configuration
- Delegator service reference

**Usage Pattern**:
- Uses `defer` for initialization and shutdown operations
- Manual lock/unlock for generation methods to avoid holding locks during long-running LLM calls

**Critical Sections**:
- `Start()`: Protects initialization of LLM instances and delegator
- `Stop()`: Protects cleanup of resources
- `GenerateText()`: Protects access to the delegator before generation
- `GenerateTextWithProvider()`: Protects finding the LLM instance before generation
- `GenerateTextWithMOA()`: Protects access to the MOA instance before generation
- `GenerateTextWithContextManager()`: Protects access to the context manager before generation
- Other generation methods: Follow similar pattern of protecting service state checks

**Special Considerations**:
- Generation methods unlock before making potentially long-running LLM API calls to avoid blocking other operations
- Captures necessary references under lock, then releases lock before API calls

### 2. Provider-Level Mutexes

These mutexes protect the state of individual LLM providers.

#### 2.1 Cerebras Provider Mutex

**Location**: `inference/cerebras_provider.go`

```go
type CerebrasProvider struct {
    // ...
    mutex sync.Mutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- API client configuration
- Request parameters
- Token counting state

**Usage Pattern**:
- Uses `defer` for most operations
- Manual lock/unlock for some operations to minimize lock duration

**Critical Sections**:
- `Generate()`: Protects access to client configuration during generation
- `CountTokens()`: Protects token counting operations
- Other API methods: Protect client access and parameter configuration

#### 2.2 Gemini Provider Mutex

**Location**: `inference/gemini_provider.go`

```go
type GeminiProvider struct {
    // ...
    mutex sync.Mutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- Gemini client configuration
- API parameters

#### 2.3 DeepSeek Provider Mutex

**Location**: `inference/deepseek_provider.go`

```go
type DeepSeekProvider struct {
    // ...
    mutex sync.Mutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- DeepSeek client configuration
- API parameters

### 3. UI-Level Mutexes

These mutexes protect UI state and prevent race conditions in the user interface.

#### 3.1 ContentManagerView Dialog Mutex

**Location**: `ui/content_manager_view.go`

```go
type ContentManagerView struct {
    // ...
    dialogMutex sync.Mutex // Mutex for dialog operations
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- Dialog display state

**Usage Pattern**:
- Explicit lock/unlock around dialog operations
- Ensures only one dialog is shown at a time

**Critical Sections**:
- `loadPagePreview()`: Protects dialog operations during page preview loading
- Dialog show/hide operations in various methods

**Special Considerations**:
- Prevents multiple dialogs from being shown simultaneously, which could confuse users
- Ensures proper sequencing of progress dialogs and result/error dialogs

#### 3.2 UILogWriter Mutex

**Location**: `ui/test_inference_view.go`

```go
type UILogWriter struct {
    // ...
    mu sync.Mutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- Log buffer
- UI log widget updates

**Usage Pattern**:
- Uses `defer` to ensure unlock happens

**Critical Sections**:
- `Write()`: Protects buffer updates and UI widget access during log writing

### 4. Memory Management Mutexes

#### 4.1 ConversationMemory RWMutex

**Location**: `inference/conversation_memory.go`

```go
type ConversationMemory struct {
    // ...
    mu sync.RWMutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- Conversation history
- Message storage

**Usage Pattern**:
- Uses read locks (`RLock`) for read-only operations
- Uses write locks (`Lock`) for operations that modify the conversation history

**Critical Sections**:
- `AddMessage()`: Protects adding new messages to the conversation (write lock)
- `GetMessages()`: Protects reading the message history (read lock)
- `Clear()`: Protects clearing the conversation history (write lock)
- `GetFormattedHistory()`: Protects reading and formatting the history (read lock)

**Special Considerations**:
- Uses `RWMutex` to allow concurrent reads while ensuring exclusive access for writes
- Optimizes for the common case of multiple readers and occasional writers

### 5. Function-Level Mutexes

These mutexes are created within specific functions to protect local resources.

#### 5.1 Context Manager Error Mutex

**Location**: `inference/context_manager.go`

```go
func (cm *ContextManager) processChunksParallel(...) {
    // ...
    var errMutex sync.Mutex
    // ...
}
```

**Protected Resources**:
- Last error variable in parallel processing

**Usage Pattern**:
- Local mutex created within the function
- Explicit lock/unlock around error updates

**Critical Sections**:
- Error recording during parallel chunk processing

**Special Considerations**:
- Only used within the scope of the `processChunksParallel` function
- Ensures thread-safe updates to the error variable from multiple goroutines

## Concurrency Patterns

### 1. Lock Hierarchies

The application generally follows a top-down locking hierarchy:

1. Service-level locks (WordPressService, InferenceService)
2. Provider-level locks (Cerebras, Gemini, DeepSeek)
3. UI-level locks (dialog operations)
4. Function-level locks (local resources)

This hierarchy helps prevent deadlocks by ensuring locks are always acquired in a consistent order.

### 2. Lock Duration Minimization

The application employs several techniques to minimize lock duration:

1. **Capture and Release**: Capture necessary references under lock, then release the lock before performing long operations
   ```go
   s.mutex.Lock()
   delegatorInstance := s.delegator
   s.mutex.Unlock()
   // Now use delegatorInstance without holding the lock
   ```

2. **Manual Lock/Unlock**: For operations where `defer` would hold the lock too long
   ```go
   s.mutex.Lock()
   // Short critical section
   s.mutex.Unlock()
   // Long operation without lock
   ```

3. **Read-Write Locks**: For data structures with many readers and few writers
   ```go
   m.mu.RLock() // Multiple readers can acquire this lock simultaneously
   defer m.mu.RUnlock()
   ```

### 3. Goroutine Management

The application uses goroutines for concurrent operations, particularly for:

1. **UI Responsiveness**: Long-running operations are performed in goroutines to keep the UI responsive
   ```go
   go func() {
       // Long-running operation
       // Update UI when complete
   }()
   ```

2. **Parallel Processing**: The Context Manager uses goroutines for parallel chunk processing
   ```go
   var wg sync.WaitGroup
   for i, chunk := range chunks {
       wg.Add(1)
       go func(index int, chunkText string) {
           defer wg.Done()
           // Process chunk
       }(i, chunk)
   }
   wg.Wait()
   ```

## Best Practices Observed

1. **Consistent Lock/Unlock Pairing**: Every lock operation has a corresponding unlock operation
2. **Use of defer for Unlock**: Ensures unlock happens even on error paths
3. **Minimizing Critical Sections**: Locks are held for the minimum time necessary
4. **Clear Documentation**: Comments explain the purpose of locks and protected resources
5. **Avoiding Nested Locks**: The application generally avoids acquiring multiple locks at once

## Potential Improvements

1. **Deadlock Detection**: Consider adding deadlock detection or timeout mechanisms for locks
2. **Lock Contention Monitoring**: Add instrumentation to monitor lock contention in high-traffic scenarios
3. **Finer-Grained Locking**: Consider breaking down large mutexes into more focused locks for specific resources
4. **Context Propagation**: Ensure all long-running operations accept and respect context cancellation

## Conclusion

The Wordpress Inference Engine application employs a well-structured approach to concurrency management using mutexes at various levels. The design generally follows best practices for lock usage, with special attention to minimizing lock duration for performance-critical operations and preventing deadlocks through consistent lock ordering.
