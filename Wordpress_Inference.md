## Implementation Plan: AI-Powered WordPress Content Management in Fyne

This implementation plan outlines the major steps, components, and considerations for building an AI-powered WordPress content management tool within your Fyne application.

**Phase 1: Core WordPress Integration & Basic Content Update**

*   **Goal:** Connect to a WordPress site, fetch pages, and manually update content via the UI.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Add WordPress Client Library:** Integrate a Go library for interacting with the WordPress REST API (e.g., `go-wordpress` or build necessary HTTP clients). Handle authentication using Application Passwords (recommended for security and ease of use compared to user/pass).
    *   **New UI Tab ("Content Manager"):**
        *   Create a new tab in the Fyne UI.
        *   Add input fields for: WordPress Site URL, Username, Application Password.
        *   Add a "Connect" button.
        *   Add a status label (e.g., "Disconnected", "Connected", "Error").
        *   Add a `widget.List` or `widget.Select` to display fetched pages/posts.
        *   Add a `widget.Entry` (multiline) to display/edit the selected page's content.
        *   Add a "Save Content" button.
    *   **WordPress Service Logic:**
        *   Create a new Go package (e.g., `wordpress`) or service struct (`WordPressService`).
        *   Implement `Connect(url, user, appPassword)` function: Authenticates with the WP site, stores the client/token.
        *   Implement `GetPages()` function: Fetches a list of pages (titles, IDs) using the WP API.
        *   Implement `GetPageContent(pageID)` function: Fetches the full content for a specific page ID.
        *   Implement `UpdatePageContent(pageID, newContent)` function: Updates the content of a specific page using the WP API.
    *   **UI <-> Service Interaction:**
        *   "Connect" button calls `WordPressService.Connect`. Update status label based on success/failure. On success, call `GetPages` and populate the page list widget.
        *   Selecting a page in the list calls `GetPageContent` and displays it in the content editor entry.
        *   "Save Content" button takes text from the editor entry and calls `UpdatePageContent`. Show success/error feedback (e.g., `dialog.ShowInformation`).

```go
// --- Main Tabs ---
	tabs := container.NewAppTabs(
		// container.NewTabItem("Content Manager", contentManagerView.Container()),
		// container.NewTabItem("Editor", widget.NewLabel("Edit Content")), // Add back when implemented
		// container.NewTabItem("Generation", widget.NewLabel("Content Generation Content")), // Add back when implemented
		// container.NewTabItem("Page Preview", ui.PageView(w, inferenceService).CreateRenderer().Objects()[0]), // Instantiate the view
		// container.NewTabItem("Automated CRM", widget.NewLabel("Automated CRM")), // Add back when implemented
		container.NewTabItem("Settings", settingsContainer), // Already Implemented
		container.NewTabItem("Test Inference", testContainer), // Already Implemented
	)
```

**Phase 2: AI Content Generation Integration**

*   **Goal:** Use the existing `InferenceService` to generate new content based on the selected WordPress page.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Add "Generate Content" UI:**
        *   Add a button like "Generate New Content with AI" to the "WordPress Manager" tab.
        *   (Optional) Add a small input field for a prompt/topic hint for the AI.
    *   **Update WordPress Service/UI Logic:**
        *   When "Generate Content" is clicked:
            *   Get the currently selected page's content (or use the prompt hint).
            *   Construct a suitable prompt for the `InferenceService` (e.g., "Rewrite the following content to be more engaging: [page content]"). You might need new prompt templates in your inference package.
            *   Call `InferenceService.GenerateText(prompt)`. Use a progress dialog as this can take time.
            *   On success, populate the content editor `widget.Entry` with the AI-generated response.
            *   Allow the user to review/edit the generated content before saving it using the existing "Save Content" button.

**Phase 3: AI-Driven "Redesign" (Content Replacement)**

*   **Goal:** Streamline the process: select a page, click "Redesign", AI generates content, and updates the page automatically.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Add "AI Redesign" UI:**
        *   Add a button like "Redesign Page with AI".
    *   **Combine Generation & Update Logic:**
        *   When "AI Redesign" is clicked:
            *   Get the selected page ID and its current content.
            *   Show a progress dialog ("Redesigning... Fetching content... Generating... Updating...").
            *   Construct the generation prompt.
            *   Call `InferenceService.GenerateText`.
            *   On successful generation, immediately call `WordPressService.UpdatePageContent` with the generated content.
            *   Update the content editor in the UI with the new content.
            *   Show success/error feedback.

**Phase 4: Implementing the "Small Screen" Preview**

*   **Goal:** Display a visual representation of the target WordPress page within the Fyne app.
*   **Challenge:** Fyne does not have a built-in web view widget. Embedding a full browser is complex and platform-dependent.
*   **Proposed Solution (Screenshot Method):**
    *   **Add Headless Browser Library:** Integrate a Go library for controlling a headless browser, like `chromedp`. This requires Chrome/Chromium to be installed on the user's machine where the Go app runs.
    *   **Add Preview Area UI:**
        *   Add an `widget.Image` widget to the "WordPress Manager" tab to display the preview. Size it appropriately (e.g., scale down).
        *   Add a "Refresh Preview" button.
    *   **Screenshot Logic (`WordPressService` or separate `PreviewService`):**
        *   Implement `GetPageScreenshot(pageURL) ([]byte, error)`:
            *   Use `chromedp` to:
                *   Navigate to the public URL of the WordPress page.
                *   Wait for the page to load (e.g., wait for a specific element or a timeout).
                *   Capture a screenshot of the viewport or the full page.
                *   Return the screenshot data (e.g., PNG bytes).
    *   **UI Integration:**
        *   After a successful "Connect", or when a page is selected, or when "Refresh Preview" is clicked:
            *   Determine the public URL of the selected page (you might need to fetch this via the WP API or construct it from the site URL and page slug).
            *   Call `GetPageScreenshot`.
            *   Convert the returned byte data into a Fyne resource (`fyne.NewStaticResource`) and update the `widget.Image` using `imageWidget.Image = ...; imageWidget.Refresh().`
            *   Trigger a preview refresh automatically after "Save Content" or "AI Redesign" completes successfully.

**Phase 5: Refinements & Error Handling**

*   **Goal:** Improve usability, robustness, and feedback.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Add specific error handling for WP API errors (authentication failed, page not found, update failed, rate limits), AI errors (generation failed, content inappropriate), and screenshot errors (Chrome not found, navigation failed, timeout). Display clear error messages to the user using `dialog.ShowError`.
    *   **Configuration:** Allow saving/loading WP connection details (securely store the Application Password, perhaps not at all, forcing reentry each time).
    *   **Progress Indicators:** Use `dialog.NewProgress` or `dialog.NewProgressInfinite` for all long-running operations (connecting, fetching pages, generating content, updating content, taking screenshots).
    *   **Cancellation:** Allow cancellation of long-running AI or screenshot tasks (using `context.Context` propagation).
    *   **Settings:** Potentially add settings for AI prompts or screenshot quality/dimensions.
    *   **UI Layout:** Refine the layout of the "WordPress Manager" tab for better usability.

**Key Considerations & Challenges:**

*   **Security:** Handling WordPress credentials (Application Passwords) securely is paramount. Avoid storing them plaintext. Prompting each time might be safest.
*   **WordPress API Limits:** Be mindful of potential rate limiting on the WordPress host.
*   **"Redesign" Scope:** This plan focuses on content replacement. True visual redesign (themes, CSS, layout blocks) is much harder via API and depends heavily on the specific theme/plugins used on the WP site. Start simple.
*   **Headless Browser Dependency:** The screenshot method requires Chrome/Chromium installation, adding an external dependency. Communicate this requirement to the user.
*   **Preview Accuracy:** Screenshots are static and might not perfectly represent dynamic elements or user-specific views. It's a preview, not a fully interactive browser.
*   **Performance:** Fetching content, generating AI text, and taking screenshots can be slow. Use goroutines and progress indicators extensively to keep the UI responsive.
*   **LLM Costs:** Frequent AI generation will incur costs depending on the provider and model used.

This plan provides a phased approach. You can start with Phase 1 to get the basic connection working and gradually add the AI and preview features. Good luck!

Here's a breakdown of how a companion plugin could potentially help:

Custom API Endpoints for Complex Actions:

Problem: The standard WordPress REST API is comprehensive but might not expose every single theme option, plugin setting, or specific workflow you need for a deep "redesign". Chaining multiple standard API calls to achieve a complex task can be slow or cumbersome.
Plugin Solution: You could create custom REST API endpoints within the plugin (using register_rest_route). Your Go application could then call these specific endpoints. This allows you to bundle complex server-side logic (PHP within WordPress) into a single API call.
Example: An endpoint like /my-redesign-plugin/v1/update_hero_section could take parameters for text, image ID, and button link, and the PHP code within the plugin would handle updating the specific theme options or page builder elements directly, which might be much harder via the standard API alone.
Deeper Theme/Plugin Integration:

Problem: Different themes and page builders (Elementor, Beaver Builder, Gutenberg blocks) store their content and settings in unique ways. The standard API might just give you raw HTML or complex JSON structures that are hard for your Go app to parse and modify reliably.
Plugin Solution: The plugin, running inside WordPress, can use the theme's or page builder's specific PHP functions and hooks to interact with their data structures more intelligently. Your custom endpoints could then provide or accept data in a format that's easier for your Go app to handle.
Optimized Data Fetching:

Problem: You might need a specific combination of data that requires multiple standard API calls.
Plugin Solution: A custom endpoint in the plugin could perform the necessary WordPress queries (using WP_Query, get_posts, etc.) server-side and return exactly the data your Go app needs in a single response.
Action Hooks & Workflow Integration:

Plugin Solution: The plugin could hook into WordPress actions. For example, after your Go app updates a page via the API (standard or custom), the plugin could automatically trigger other actions within WordPress, like clearing specific caches, logging the change, or notifying other plugins.
Simplified Setup/Status:

Plugin Solution: The plugin could potentially offer a settings page within the WordPress admin area to manage the connection or view logs related to your Go application's activity.
However, there are trade-offs:

Increased Development Complexity: You now need to develop and maintain two separate pieces of software (the Go app and the PHP WordPress plugin).
Deployment: Users would need to install and activate the plugin on their WordPress site in addition to running your Go application.
Security: Custom API endpoints need careful security considerations (authentication, authorization, input validation) to avoid opening vulnerabilities on the WordPress site.
Maintenance: Keeping the plugin compatible with WordPress updates, theme updates, etc., adds overhead.
Recommendation:

Start without a plugin: Focus on implementing the core features using the standard WordPress REST API first. You can achieve login (Application Passwords), fetching pages/posts, and updating standard content (post_content) this way. The screenshot preview can also be done entirely from the Go app using chromedp.
Identify Limitations: As you develop, see if you hit roadblocks where the standard API is insufficient for the "redesign" tasks you envision. Are you trying to modify complex theme options? Interact deeply with a specific page builder? Are standard API calls becoming too slow or complex?
Consider a Plugin If Needed: If you encounter significant limitations with the standard API, then developing a small, focused companion plugin to expose specific custom endpoints for those complex tasks makes sense.
In summary, a plugin isn't essential to get started with the API approach, but it's a powerful tool to keep in your back pocket if you need deeper integration or more complex control over the WordPress site than the standard REST API offers.
